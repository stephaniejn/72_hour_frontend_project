The Harry Potter game is a fun, easy to play Quintus-style game. Watch out for the dementors, capture the golden snitches and try to reach the broomstick!

I created the game for an assignment in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. The assignment was a 72-hour front-end project to learn and utilize an external JavaScript library. I built the game using Quintus, HTML and Tiled Map Editor.
